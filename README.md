InstantMessenger
================

An Instant Messaging software (IM) which supports distributed group communication, collaborative editing and network jitter detection and recovery using Java RMI.

This is a course project for Comp 790-063: Implementing Distributed Collaborative Systems. The link for the course is here: http://www.cs.unc.edu/~dewan/colab-impl/current/index.html. I'm the sole programmer of this project.

To run the program: 

(1) load the project using Eclipse 

(2) run the class AppLauncher.java 

(3) double click the items shown in the UI in order, i.e., first double click RMIRegistryStarter, then SessionServer, then RelayServer, then ClientLauncher 

(4) to create more users, double click ClientLauncher again 

(5) enjoy!
